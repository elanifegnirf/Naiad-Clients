Naming Conventions
==================

This document describes naming conventions used in the Naiad Studio source
code.

Use the naming conventions to understand the purpose of a class or function,
and when you write your own code, to make the code consistent.


Classes
-------

The following naming conventions describe the naming of Naiad Studio classes.

1. All Naiad Studio classes start with 'Ns'.

2. Classes that inherit from a Qt class and can be seen as the "Naiad Studio
   version" of that class have the same name as the Qt class, but starting
   with 'Ns' instead of 'Q'. This can be the case for a base class, from which
   other Naiad Studio classes inherit, or a class that is the only class that
   inherits from the corresponding Qt class.

   NsMainWindow
   NsSplashScreen

3. Classes that are a specialisation of a Qt class have a name that is
   similar to the Qt class, but also contains a word (or two) describing in
   which way it is specialised.

   NsAboutDialog
   NsGlobalParameterWidget
   NsGraphView
   NsSetNopParameterCommand


Signals
-------

The following naming conventions describe the naming of Naiad Studio signals.

1. A signal sent when a command has been executed describes the change that
   was made by the command, and ends with 'Changed'.

   globalParameterChanged()
   selectionChanged()


Slots
-----

The following naming conventions describe the naming of Naiad Studio slots.

1. A slot that is used to execute a command ends with 'Command'.

   setGlobalParameterCommand()
   saveCommand()

2. A slot or function that implements the functionalty of an undo command has
   the same name as the slot used to execute the command, but without the
   'Command' suffix.

   setGlobalParameter()
   save()
   
3. A slot that corresponds directly to a signal sent when a command has been
   executed starts with 'on', followed by the name of the signal.

   onGlobalParameterChanged()
   onSelectionChanged()

4. A slot that performs some form of update, but does not corresponding
   directly to the signal it is connected to, has a name that starts with
   'update'.

   updateSaveAction()
   updateWindowTitle()


Functions
---------

The following naming conventions describe the naming of Naiad Studio functions
in general, regardless of them being slots or not.

1. A function that adds a given object to a container or other data structure
   has a name that starts with 'add'.

   addNopItem(NsNopItem *item)

2. A fucntion that creates an object from the given data and adds it to a
   container or other data structure has a name that starts with 'create'.

   createNopItem(const QString &name)
